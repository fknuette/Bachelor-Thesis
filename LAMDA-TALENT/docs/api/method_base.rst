The **Method** class serves as the base class for all models implemented in TALENT. It is designed to handle various tasks, including binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression. 

**Key Methods:**

- **__init__(self, args, is_regression)**: Initializes the method with given arguments and task type (regression or classification).
- **reset_stats_withconfig(self, config)**: Resets training statistics and sets new configuration.
- **data_format(self, is_train=True, N=None, C=None, y=None)**: Formats the data, processes missing values, encodes numerical and categorical features, and normalizes the data.
- **fit(self, data, info, train=True, config=None)**: Trains the model with the provided data and configuration. It handles the entire training loop including validation.
- **predict(self, data, info, model_name)**: Loads a pre-trained model and performs predictions on the given data.
- **train_epoch(self, epoch)**: Executes one training epoch, including forward pass, loss computation, and backpropagation.
- **validate(self, epoch)**: Validates the model on the validation set after each training epoch.
- **metric(self, predictions, labels, y_info)**: Computes various performance metrics based on the task type (e.g., regression, binary classification, multiclass classification).

Functions
==========================

.. autofunction:: TALENT.model.methods.base.check_softmax
   Checks and converts logits into softmax probabilities if needed.


==========================
Training and Evaluation
==========================

The **Method** class provides a robust pipeline for training and evaluating machine learning models, handling the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: It processes missing values, encodes categorical features, normalizes numerical features, and prepares data for training.
2. **Training Loop**: The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer with configurable learning rate and weight decay.
3. **Validation**: After each epoch, the model is validated on a separate validation set. Early stopping is employed if validation performance does not improve.
4. **Evaluation**: The model can be evaluated using various metrics depending on the task type (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, R2 score, etc.).

==========================
Performance Metrics
==========================

The **metric** function in the **Method** class computes various metrics based on the task type:

- **For regression**:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R2 Score

- **For binary classification**:
  - Accuracy
  - Average Precision
  - F1 Score
  - Log Loss
  - Area Under the Curve (AUC)

- **For multiclass classification**:
  - Accuracy
  - Average Precision
  - F1 Score
  - Log Loss
  - AUC

This ensures that the performance of the models is measured comprehensively across different tasks.
