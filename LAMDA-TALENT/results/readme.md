We have curated and released [new benchmark datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j1zt3zQIo8dO6vkO-K-WE6pSrl71bf0z?usp=drive_link), along with updated [results](https://6sy666.github.io/TALENT-Results/) of the dataset across a broader range of methods. This update focuses on enhancing dataset quality, including removing duplicates, and correcting tasks where bin-class was mistakenly treated as regression. We have also separated the larger datasets and formed the basic benchmark (300 datasets, including 120 bin-class, 80 multi-class, and 100 regression), and the large benchmark (22 datasets).
